🎬 A Hybrid Movie Recommendation System Leveraging KNN and TF-IDF
📌 Overview
This project is a hybrid movie recommendation system that combines K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and TF-IDF techniques to deliver personalized movie recommendations. The system utilizes movie metadata like plot summaries, genres, and other attributes to find movies similar to user preferences.

The project is deployed and live here: Movie Recommendation System.

🚀 Features
Content-Based Filtering: Leverages TF-IDF to analyze movie plot summaries and identify important keywords.
Similarity Matching: Implements KNN to compute similarities between movies based on extracted TF-IDF features.
Hybrid Approach: Combines content-based and collaborative techniques for accurate and diverse recommendations.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple web-based interface to input movies and view recommendations.
🔧 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Machine Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
NLP Techniques: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text feature extraction.
Libraries:
pandas and numpy - Data manipulation
scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms and TF-IDF
Flask - Backend framework for deployment
HTML/CSS - Frontend interface
Deployment: Hosted on Render.
📊 How It Works
Data Preprocessing:

Movie metadata (title, plot, genres) is cleaned and processed.
TF-IDF transforms movie plots into numerical vectors, highlighting key terms.
Similarity Computation:

KNN computes similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.
The system identifies movies closest to the user-selected movie(s).
Recommendations:

Based on the similarity scores, the top N most relevant movies are recommended.
